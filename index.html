                Hello World! My name is Adrian Aarland. I'm a Computer Scientist with a degree from the University
                of St. Thomas. I was raised on an island on the west coast of Norway. Being far away from anything, 
                one of the key things that kept me entertained was computers and the internet. On the internet there were all
                these amazing games, one of my favorite categories was brain puzzles. Feeling a thrill everytime I was able 
                to solve them.

            <p class="about">
                The year is 2009, my first year in middle school. The iPhone 3GS was just released and I had enough money
                saved up to buy one. Many of the Apps I downloaded was games. My brother and I wanted to make games ourself,
                neither of us had any programming experience at the time so we had no idea how to even begin. We found a tutorial
                similar to the game "Papi Jump", we put in our own assets and where happy with what we had achived.
                After getting the first app working with my brother, I wanted to make my own app. I was a big Family Guy fan at the
                time, so naturally I wanted to do something with that. I created a soundboard app with one voice line from each of
                the main characters. To achive this I found a tutorial on how to play a sound with a button, and one how to change
                the look of the button.
