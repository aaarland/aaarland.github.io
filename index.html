        <p id="about">Hello World! My name is Adrian Aarland. I'm a Computer Scientist with a degree from the University
            of St. Thomas. Before getting my degree in the United States I was a student at the University og Bergen, studying Digital Culture.
            During weekends I would work as a fish farmer. In High School I repaired electronics, countless iPhones, 
            some iPads, a couple of Samsungs, and a few laptops.
